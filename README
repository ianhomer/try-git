# Conflict Experiments

Make conflicts

    ./make-conflicts.sh

Then pull conflicts into feature branch

    git checkout feature/conflicting
    git pull origin master

Resolve by fixing merges in files/conflictable.txt

    git commit -am "Resolve conflicts"

Merge feature branch to master

    git checkout master
    git merge feature/conflicting
    git branch -d feature/conflicting
    git push origin --delete feature/conflicting
